Patients with PCOS have problems with ovulation, insulin resistance and abnormally high levels of androgens.<br/>Polycystic ovary syndrome is so called because women with this condition usually have a number of cysts on the ovaries (generally twice the norm), no larger than 8 mm in diameter each). They are located far from the surface of the ovaries and contain follicles that have not developed properly due to a number of hormonal abnormalities. The egg cannot mature in such follicles. Subsequently, pregnancy occurrence is impossible. This pathology is successfully diagnosed with the use of screening during ultrasound scanning.</p>"
