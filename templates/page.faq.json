Alternatively, the tablets may be swallowed with thicker liquids such as yoghurts or smoothies.<\/p><p>If you are looking for an alternative to tablets, then we also offer a range of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vitabiotics.com\/collections\/liquid-vitamins\">Liquid Vitamins<\/a> and chewable <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vitabiotics.com\/collections\/vitamin-gummies\">Vitamin Gummies<\/a>. <\/p>",
